User: ok jarvis which mobile phone is trending
Gemini: I don't have access to real-time sales data or trending information that changes rapidly, like what the most trending mobile phone is at any given moment.  That kind of data is constantly fluctuating.

To find out which mobile phones are currently trending, I suggest checking popular tech news websites and blogs, YouTube tech reviewers, or social media platforms (like Twitter or TikTok) to see what's being discussed and reviewed.

User: jarvis about mi
Gemini: "MI" can refer to several things.  To give you helpful information, I need more context.  Do you mean:

* **Xiaomi (MI):**  The Chinese electronics company that makes smartphones, smart home devices, and other consumer electronics?
* **MI (in another context):**  Something else entirely?  Perhaps an abbreviation in a specific field?

Please clarify what you'd like to know about MI.
